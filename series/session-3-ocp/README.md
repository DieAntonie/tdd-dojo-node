# Code Dojo Session 3: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

## Objective:
- Explore the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) and its significance in software design.
- Refactor the existing codebase to adhere to OCP by designing modules and classes that are open for extension but closed for modification.

## Agenda:
1. **Introduction to OCP**:
   - Brief overview of the [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](open-close-principle.md) and its importance in software design.
   - Explanation of the benefits of adhering to OCP.

2. **Analyzing Existing Codebase**:
   - Group review of the codebase from Session 2.
   - Discussion on identifying areas where the codebase [violates the OCP](ocp-violations.md).

3. **Identifying Extension Points**:
   - Divide participants into pairs.
   - Instruct participants to identify areas of the codebase that are likely to change or be extended in the future.

4. **Designing for Extension**:
   - Instruct participants to [refactor the codebase](ocp-refactor.md) to design modules and classes that are open for extension but closed for modification.
   - Encourage participants to use techniques such as abstraction, inheritance, and composition to achieve this goal.

5. **Testing Refactored Code**:
   - Instruct participants to write tests to verify that the refactored code behaves as expected.
   - Conduct group review of the tests and the refactored code.

6. **Review and Discussion**:
   - Facilitate a group discussion on the challenges faced during the refactoring process.
   - Encourage participants to share insights and experiences.
   - Discuss best practices for designing modules and classes that adhere to the Open/Closed Principle (OCP).

## Materials Needed:
- Codebase from Session 2.
- Whiteboard or screen sharing capability for group discussions.
- Code editor and compiler/interpreter for participants to write and test code.

## Key Takeaways:
- Understanding of the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) and its role in software design.
- Practice in identifying areas of code that violate OCP and refactoring them to adhere to the principle.
- Experience in designing modules and classes that are open for extension but closed for modification.
