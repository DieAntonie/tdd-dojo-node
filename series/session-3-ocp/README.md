# Code Dojo Session 3: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

## Objective:
- Introduce the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) and its role in creating flexible and extensible software systems.
- Modify the program to allow for the addition of new features without modifying existing code.

## Agenda:
1. **Introduction to OCP**:
   - Brief overview of the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) and its benefits.
   - Explanation of the importance of designing software to be open for extension but closed for modification.
   
2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - Group review of the codebase from Session 2.
   - Discussion on areas where the codebase can be extended without modification.
   
3. **Modifying the Program**:
   - Divide participants into pairs.
   - Instruct participants to identify areas of the codebase that can be extended to accommodate new features.
   - Guide participants in implementing extension points within the program.
   
4. **Implementing Extension Points**:
   - Instruct participants to add mechanisms to the program to allow for the addition of new book genres or features.
   - Encourage participants to follow the principles of abstraction and encapsulation.
   
5. **Testing Extension Points**:
   - Instruct participants to write tests to ensure that the program remains functional after adding new features.
   - Conduct group review of the tests and the modified code.
   
6. **Review and Discussion**:
   - Facilitate a group discussion on the application of the Open/Closed Principle (OCP).
   - Encourage participants to share insights and experiences.
   - Discuss best practices for designing flexible and extensible software architectures.

## Materials Needed:
- Codebase from Session 2.
- Whiteboard or screen sharing capability for group discussions.
- Code editor and compiler/interpreter for participants to write and test code.

## Key Takeaways:
- Understanding of the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) and its significance in software design.
- Practice in identifying areas of a codebase that can be extended without modification.
- Experience in modifying software to accommodate new features without altering existing code.
