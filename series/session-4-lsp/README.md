# Code Dojo Session 4: Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP)

## Objective:
- Introduce Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP) and its implications for object-oriented design.
- Refactor the program to ensure that derived classes can be substituted for their base classes without altering the correctness of the program.

## Agenda:
1. **Understanding LSP**:
   - Brief overview of Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP) and its importance.
   - Explanation of the role of LSP in designing class hierarchies.
   
2. **Analyzing Class Hierarchies**:
   - Group review of the codebase from Session 3.
   - Discussion on the existing class hierarchies and potential violations of LSP.
   
3. **Ensuring Substitutability**:
   - Divide participants into pairs.
   - Instruct participants to refactor the code to ensure that derived classes can be substituted for their base classes without altering behavior.
   - Encourage participants to focus on maintaining the behavior of the program while making changes.
   
4. **Writing Tests**:
   - Instruct participants to write tests to verify that substitutability has been maintained after refactoring.
   - Conduct group review of the tests and the modified code.
   
5. **Review and Discussion**:
   - Facilitate a group discussion on the application of Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP).
   - Encourage participants to share insights and experiences.
   - Discuss best practices for designing class hierarchies that adhere to LSP.

## Materials Needed:
- Codebase from Session 3.
- Whiteboard or screen sharing capability for group discussions.
- Code editor and compiler/interpreter for participants to write and test code.

## Key Takeaways:
- Understanding of Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP) and its significance in object-oriented design.
- Practice in refactoring code to ensure substitutability without altering behavior.
- Experience in designing flexible and maintainable class hierarchies that adhere to LSP.
