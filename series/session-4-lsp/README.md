# Code Dojo Session 4: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

## Objective:
- Explore the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) and its significance in software design.
- Refactor the existing codebase to adhere to LSP by ensuring that subclasses can be substituted for their base classes without altering the correctness of the program.

## Agenda:
1. **Introduction to LSP**:
   - Brief review of the [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](liskov-substitution-principle.md) and its importance in software design.
   - Explanation of the benefits of adhering to LSP.

2. **Analyzing Existing Codebase**:
   - Group review of the codebase from Session 3.
   - Discussion on identifying areas where the codebase [violates LSP](lsp-violations.md).

3. **Identifying Substitutability**:
   - Divide participants into pairs.
   - Instruct participants to identify subclasses that violate LSP by behaving in a way that is inconsistent with the behavior of their base classes.

4. **Refactoring Code**:
   - Instruct participants to [refactor the codebase](lsp-refactor.md) to ensure that subclasses can be substituted for their base classes without altering the correctness of the program.
   - Encourage participants to use techniques such as inheritance, composition, and overriding methods to achieve this goal.

5. **Testing Refactored Code**:
   - Instruct participants to write tests to verify that the refactored code behaves as expected.
   - Conduct group review of the tests and the refactored code.

6. **Review and Discussion**:
   - Facilitate a group discussion on the challenges faced during the refactoring process.
   - Encourage participants to share insights and experiences.
   - Discuss best practices for designing classes that adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).

## Materials Needed:
- Codebase from Session 3.
- Whiteboard or screen sharing capability for group discussions.
- Code editor and compiler/interpreter for participants to write and test code.

## Key Takeaways:
- Understanding of the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) and its role in software design.
- Practice in identifying violations of LSP and refactoring code to adhere to the principle.
- Experience in designing classes that support substitutability and maintain correctness when substituting subclasses for their base classes.
