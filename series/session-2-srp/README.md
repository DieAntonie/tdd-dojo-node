# Code Dojo Session 2: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

## Objective:
- Explore the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and its significance in software design.
- Refactor the existing codebase to adhere to SRP by separating concerns.

## Agenda:
1. **Understanding SRP**:
   - Brief review of [SRP principles and its importance in software design](single-responsibility-principle.md).
   - Explanation of the benefits of adhering to SRP.
   
2. **Analyzing Existing Codebase**:
   - Group review of the code written in Session 1.
   - Discussion on identifying areas where responsibilities are not clearly separated.
   
3. **Identifying Responsibilities**:
   - Divide participants into pairs.
   - Instruct participants to analyze the existing codebase and identify areas of responsibility.
   
4. **Refactoring Code**:
   - Instruct participants to [refactor the code](srp-refactored-ims.md) to separate responsibilities into distinct modules or classes.
   - Encourage participants to focus on creating classes with single responsibilities.
   - Provide guidance and assistance as needed.
   
5. **Testing Refactored Code**:
   - Instruct participants to write additional tests to verify that the refactored code behaves as expected.
   - Conduct group review of the tests and the refactored code.
   
6. **Review and Discussion**:
   - Facilitate a group discussion on the challenges faced during the refactoring process.
   - Encourage participants to share insights and experiences.
   - Discuss best practices for designing classes with single responsibilities.

## Materials Needed:
- Codebase from Session 1.
- Whiteboard or screen sharing capability for group discussions.
- Code editor and compiler/interpreter for participants to write and test code.

## Key Takeaways:
- Understanding of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and its role in software design.
- Practice in identifying and separating responsibilities within a codebase.
- Experience in refactoring code to adhere to SRP principles.
