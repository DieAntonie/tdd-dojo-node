Let's refactor the basic inventory management functionalities from Session 1, focusing on creating classes with single responsibilities and separating responsibilities into distinct modules or classes. We'll break down the responsibilities into smaller, cohesive units of functionality. Here's how we can approach the refactoring process:

## Step 1: Identify Responsibilities
Identify the distinct responsibilities within the existing codebase. For example:
- Managing the inventory (adding, removing, listing books)
- Book representation

## Step 2: Create Classes with Single Responsibilities
Create separate classes for each responsibility identified in Step 1. For example:
1. **InventoryManager**: Responsible for managing the inventory.
2. **Book**: Responsible for representing individual books.

## Step 3: Refactor Existing Code
Refactor the existing code to use the newly created classes. Ensure that each class has a single responsibility.

## Step 4: Implement Dependency Injection
To adhere to the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), inject dependencies into classes rather than hard-coding them. For example, inject an instance of the InventoryManager into other classes that require it.

## Step 5: Write Tests
Write tests to verify the behavior of the refactored code. Ensure that each class is tested in isolation, mocking any dependencies as needed.

## Step 6: Refactor and Iterate
Refactor the code as needed, continuously striving for classes with single responsibilities and cohesive design. Iterate on the process until the codebase is well-organized and maintainable.

## Refactored Code Example:

```javascript
// InventoryManager.js
export class InventoryManager {
  constructor() {
    this.books = [];
  }

  addBook(book) {
    this.books.push(book);
  }

  removeBook(book) {
    this.books = this.books.filter(b => b !== book);
  }

  listBooks() {
    return this.books;
  }
}
```

```javascript
// Book.js
export class Book {
  constructor(title, author) {
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
  }
}
```

```javascript
// inventory.test.js
import assert from "node:assert/strict";
import { describe, it } from "node:test";
import InventoryManager from '../InventoryManager.js';
import Book from '../Book.js';

describe('InventoryManager', () => {
  let inventory;

  beforeEach(() => {
    inventory = new InventoryManager();
  });

  it('should add a book to the inventory', () => {
    // given
    const book = new Book('Test Book', 'Test Author');

    // when
    inventory.addBook(book);

    // then
    assert.deepStrictEqual(inventory.listBooks(), [book]);
  });

  it('should remove a book from the inventory', () => {
    // given
    const book = new Book('Test Book', 'Test Author');
    inventory.addBook(book);

    // when
    inventory.removeBook(book);

    // then
    assert.deepStrictEqual(inventory.listBooks(), []);
  });
});
```

## Additional Notes:
- Ensure that each class has a clear and well-defined responsibility. Avoid mixing unrelated functionality within a single class.
- Use dependency injection to decouple classes and promote flexibility and testability.
- Write comprehensive tests to cover all aspects of the refactored code and ensure its correctness.
- Continuously refactor and iterate on the codebase to improve its design and maintainability over time.

By following these steps, you can refactor the basic inventory management functionalities into classes with single responsibilities, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable, and more flexible codebase.
