The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design, coined by Robert C. Martin. It states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one responsibility or job.

## Significance of SRP in Software Design:

1. **Modularity and Encapsulation:**
   - SRP promotes modularity by encouraging classes to have a clear and specific purpose. Each class should encapsulate a single responsibility, making it easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.

2. **Reduced Complexity:**
   - By adhering to SRP, classes become more focused and less complex. This reduces the cognitive load on developers, making it easier to reason about and debug code.

3. **Improved Maintainability:**
   - When classes have a single responsibility, changes to one part of the system are less likely to impact other parts. This improves maintainability because developers can make changes to a specific class without worrying about unintended consequences elsewhere.

4. **Enhanced Testability:**
   - Classes with single responsibilities are typically easier to test because their behavior is more predictable and isolated. This makes it simpler to write unit tests, leading to a more robust and reliable codebase.

5. **Flexibility and Extensibility:**
   - SRP allows for greater flexibility and extensibility in software design. When each class has a well-defined responsibility, it becomes easier to add new features or modify existing ones without affecting the overall structure of the system.

6. **Better Code Organization:**
   - Following SRP results in better code organization. Classes are organized based on their responsibilities, leading to a clearer and more intuitive codebase structure.

## Example:
Consider a hypothetical scenario where you're building a library management system. You might have a `Book` class responsible for representing individual books, and a `Library` class responsible for managing the collection of books. Adhering to SRP, the `Book` class should only be responsible for managing book-specific data and behavior, while the `Library` class should handle operations related to managing the library's collection, such as adding, removing, and listing books.

```javascript
// Example of violating SRP

class Library {
  constructor() {
    this.books = [];
  }

  addBook(book) {
    this.books.push(book);
  }

  removeBook(book) {
    const index = this.books.indexOf(book);
    if (index !== -1) {
      this.books.splice(index, 1);
    }
  }

  displayAllBooks() {
    this.books.forEach(book => {
      console.log(book.title);
    });
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `Library` class violates SRP by having multiple responsibilities: managing the collection of books and displaying them. A better approach would be to separate these responsibilities into distinct classes, adhering to SRP:

```javascript
// Example adhering to SRP

class Library {
  constructor() {
    this.books = [];
  }

  addBook(book) {
    this.books.push(book);
  }

  removeBook(book) {
    const index = this.books.indexOf(book);
    if (index !== -1) {
      this.books.splice(index, 1);
    }
  }
}

class Book {
  constructor(title) {
    this.title = title;
  }
}
```

In this improved version, the `Library` class is responsible for managing the collection of books, while the `Book` class is responsible for representing individual books. This separation of concerns adheres to SRP, making the codebase more maintainable, testable, and flexible.
