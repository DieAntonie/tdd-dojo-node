# Code Dojo Session 5: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

## Objective:
- Introduce the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) and its role in designing cohesive interfaces.
- Refactor the program to adhere to ISP by separating large interfaces into smaller, more focused ones.

## Agenda:
1. **Introduction to ISP**:
   - Brief overview of the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) and its benefits.
   - Explanation of the importance of designing interfaces that are focused and cohesive.
   
2. **Analyzing Existing Interfaces**:
   - Group review of the codebase from Session 4.
   - Discussion on existing interfaces and potential violations of ISP.
   
3. **Refactoring Interfaces**:
   - Divide participants into pairs.
   - Instruct participants to identify interfaces within the codebase that violate ISP.
   - Guide participants in refactoring the interfaces to be more focused and cohesive.
   
4. **Implementing Interface Segregation**:
   - Instruct participants to modify classes to implement the newly defined interfaces.
   - Encourage participants to follow the principles of separation of concerns.
   
5. **Writing Tests**:
   - Instruct participants to write tests to ensure that the program remains functional after refactoring interfaces.
   - Conduct group review of the tests and the modified code.
   
6. **Review and Discussion**:
   - Facilitate a group discussion on the application of the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).
   - Encourage participants to share insights and experiences.
   - Discuss best practices for designing modular and maintainable interfaces.

## Materials Needed:
- Codebase from Session 4.
- Whiteboard or screen sharing capability for group discussions.
- Code editor and compiler/interpreter for participants to write and test code.

## Key Takeaways:
- Understanding of the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) and its significance in software design.
- Practice in refactoring interfaces to be more focused and cohesive.
- Experience in designing modular and maintainable interfaces that adhere to ISP.
