# Code Dojo Session 5: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

## Objective:
- Explore the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) and its significance in software design.
- Refactor the existing codebase to adhere to ISP by segregating interfaces into smaller and more cohesive units.

## Agenda:
1. **Introduction to ISP**:
   - Brief review of the [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](interface-segregtion-principle.md) and its importance in software design.
   - Explanation of the benefits of adhering to ISP.

2. **Analyzing Existing Codebase**:
   - Group review of the codebase from Session 4.
   - Discussion on [identifying interfaces that are not cohesive or have too many responsibilities](isp-violation.md).

3. **Identifying Cohesive Interfaces**:
   - Divide participants into pairs.
   - Instruct participants to identify interfaces that can be segregated into smaller and more cohesive units.

4. **Refactoring Code**:
   - Instruct participants to [refactor the codebase](isp-refactor.md) to segregate interfaces into smaller units that are more cohesive.
   - Encourage participants to use techniques such as interface extraction, interface splitting, and interface composition to achieve this goal.

5. **Testing Refactored Code**:
   - Instruct participants to write tests to verify that the refactored code behaves as expected.
   - Conduct group review of the tests and the refactored code.

6. **Review and Discussion**:
   - Facilitate a group discussion on the challenges faced during the refactoring process.
   - Encourage participants to share insights and experiences.
   - Discuss best practices for designing interfaces that adhere to the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).

## Materials Needed:
- Codebase from Session 4.
- Whiteboard or screen sharing capability for group discussions.
- Code editor and compiler/interpreter for participants to write and test code.

## Key Takeaways:
- Understanding of the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) and its role in software design.
- Practice in identifying interfaces that violate ISP and refactoring code to adhere to the principle.
- Experience in designing interfaces that are more cohesive and maintainable.
