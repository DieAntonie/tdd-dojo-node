The "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle is the fundamental process followed in Test-Driven Development (TDD). It consists of three phases: Red, Green, and Refactor. Let's break down each phase:

1. **Red Phase:**
   - In this phase, developers start by writing a failing test. The test is written to define the desired behavior or functionality of the software. Since the corresponding code hasn't been implemented yet, the test is expected to fail. This failing test is indicated by the color red, hence the name "Red" phase.
   - The failing test serves as a clear specification of what needs to be implemented in the code.

2. **Green Phase:**
   - After writing the failing test, developers proceed to write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass. This code should be simple and focused solely on passing the test. The goal is not to write perfect or production-quality code at this stage, but rather to get the test to pass.
   - Once the code is written and the test passes successfully, the test suite is said to be "green." This phase is called the "Green" phase because the test now passes, indicating that the implemented functionality meets the specified requirements.

3. **Refactor Phase:**
   - With the new test passing, developers can refactor the code to improve its structure, readability, and efficiency without changing its behavior. Refactoring ensures that the code remains clean, maintainable, and easy to understand.
   - It's important to note that refactoring should only be done when all tests are passing. If any tests fail during refactoring, developers should revert the changes and return to the Green phase before refactoring further.

By following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle iteratively, developers continuously add new functionality to the software while ensuring that existing functionality remains intact. This iterative process leads to the development of high-quality, reliable code with a comprehensive suite of automated tests. Additionally, the cycle encourages a disciplined approach to development and promotes code that is easy to maintain and extend over time.
