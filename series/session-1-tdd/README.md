# Code Dojo Session 1: Introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD)

## Objective:
- Introduce participants to the principles and workflow of Test Driven Development (TDD).
- Start building the foundation of the inventory management system using TDD practices.

## Agenda:
1. **Introduction to TDD**:
   - Brief overview of [TDD principles and workflow](tdd-princepals-and-workflow.md).
   - Explanation of the ["Red-Green-Refactor" cycle](red-green-refactor-cycle.md).
   
2. **Setting up the Environment**:
   - Instructions for [setting up the development environment and testing framework](setting-up-dev-test-environment.md).
   - Assistance provided for participants who encounter difficulties.

3. **Writing Test Cases**:
   - Identify test scenarios for basic inventory management functionalities:
     - Adding a book to the inventory.
     - Listing all books in the inventory.
     - Removing a book from the inventory.
   - Divide participants into pairs to work on writing test cases for each functionality.
   
4. **Implementing Code**:
   - Instruct participants to implement the code necessary to make the failing test cases pass.
   - Encourage participants to follow the TDD cycle: write a failing test, write the minimum code to pass the test, refactor if necessary.
   - Provide assistance and guidance as needed.

5. **Review and Refactor**:
   - Conduct a group review of the implemented code.
   - Discuss any challenges faced during the TDD process.
   - Identify opportunities for refactoring and improving the codebase.
   
## Materials Needed:
- Development environment setup instructions (e.g., IDE setup guide, installation instructions for testing framework).
- Codebase starter files (if applicable).
- Whiteboard or screen sharing capability for group discussions.
- Code editor and compiler/interpreter for participants to write and test code.

## Key Takeaways:
- Understanding of Test Driven Development (TDD) principles and workflow.
- Practice in writing effective test cases before writing code.
- Experience in implementing code incrementally to pass tests and improve code quality.
