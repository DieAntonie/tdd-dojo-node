# Code Dojo Session 6: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Objective:
- Introduce the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) and its benefits for creating flexible and maintainable software systems.
- Refactor the program to decouple high-level modules from low-level dependencies.

## Agenda:
1. **Introduction to DIP**:
   - Brief overview of the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) and its significance.
   - Explanation of the importance of designing software components with loosely coupled dependencies.
   
2. **Analyzing Dependencies**:
   - Group review of the codebase from Session 5.
   - Discussion on existing dependencies and potential violations of DIP.
   
3. **Implementing Dependency Injection**:
   - Divide participants into pairs.
   - Instruct participants to identify dependencies within the codebase that violate DIP.
   - Guide participants in refactoring the code to implement dependency injection and decouple high-level modules from low-level dependencies.
   
4. **Writing Tests**:
   - Instruct participants to write tests to verify that the program remains functional after implementing dependency injection.
   - Conduct group review of the tests and the modified code.
   
5. **Review and Discussion**:
   - Facilitate a group discussion on the application of the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
   - Encourage participants to share insights and experiences.
   - Discuss best practices for designing flexible and maintainable software architectures.

## Materials Needed:
- Codebase from Session 5.
- Whiteboard or screen sharing capability for group discussions.
- Code editor and compiler/interpreter for participants to write and test code.

## Key Takeaways:
- Understanding of the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) and its significance in software design.
- Practice in implementing dependency injection to decouple high-level modules from low-level dependencies.
- Experience in designing flexible and maintainable software architectures that adhere to DIP.
