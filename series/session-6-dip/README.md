# Code Dojo Session 6: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Objective:
- Explore the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) and its significance in software design.
- Refactor the existing codebase to adhere to DIP by decoupling high-level modules from low-level implementation details.

## Agenda:
1. **Introduction to DIP**:
   - Brief review of the [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](dependency-inversion-principle.md) and its importance in software design.
   - Explanation of the benefits of adhering to DIP.

2. **Analyzing Existing Codebase**:
   - Group review of the codebase from Session 5.
   - Discussion on [identifying dependencies between high-level and low-level modules](dip-violation.md).

3. **Identifying Abstractions**:
   - Divide participants into pairs.
   - Instruct participants to identify abstractions that can be used to decouple high-level modules from low-level implementation details.

4. **Implementing Abstractions**:
   - Instruct participants to [refactor the codebase](dip-refactor.md) to introduce abstractions that decouple high-level modules from low-level implementation details.
   - Encourage participants to use techniques such as dependency injection, inversion of control, and design patterns (e.g., factory pattern, strategy pattern) to achieve this goal.

5. **Testing Refactored Code**:
   - Instruct participants to write tests to verify that the refactored code behaves as expected.
   - Conduct group review of the tests and the refactored code.

6. **Review and Discussion**:
   - Facilitate a group discussion on the challenges faced during the refactoring process.
   - Encourage participants to share insights and experiences.
   - Discuss best practices for designing abstractions that adhere to the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).

## Materials Needed:
- Codebase from Session 5.
- Whiteboard or screen sharing capability for group discussions.
- Code editor and compiler/interpreter for participants to write and test code.

## Key Takeaways:
- Understanding of the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) and its role in software design.
- Practice in identifying dependencies between high-level and low-level modules and introducing abstractions to decouple them.
- Experience in designing abstractions that promote decoupling, flexibility, and maintainability.
