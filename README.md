# TDD Dojo (nodejs)
Boilerplate project for running a TDD Dojo in JavaScript using the Node.JS

## Getting Started

- Install Node Version Manager

## Case Study: [Evolution of an Inventory Management System](series/README.md)

### Overview:
In this series of Code Dojo sessions, participants will collaboratively work on refining and improving an inventory management system for an online bookstore. Throughout the series, we'll focus on applying key principles of software design, including Test Driven Development (TDD), Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open/Closed Principle (OCP), Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).

### Session Structure:
**Session 1: Introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD)**
   - Participants will begin by implementing a basic inventory management system using TDD principles.
   - Focus on writing tests before writing code and iteratively improving the design based on feedback from tests.

**Session 2: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Refactor the existing codebase to adhere to SRP by separating responsibilities for adding, removing, and listing books into distinct modules.
   - Discussion on identifying and defining clear responsibilities for classes and methods.

**Session 3: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Modify the program to make it open for extension but closed for modification, allowing for the addition of new book genres without altering existing code.
   - Explore techniques for designing flexible and extensible software systems.

**Session 4: Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Expand the program to handle different types of items (e.g., books, ebooks, audiobooks) while ensuring that each type can be substituted without altering the correctness of the inventory management system.
   - Discussion on designing class hierarchies and interfaces that adhere to LSP.

**Session 5: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Refactor interfaces used in the program to be more focused and cohesive, adhering to ISP.
   - Identify opportunities to split large interfaces into smaller, more specialized ones.

**Session 6: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - Implement dependency injection to decouple the inventory management logic from the underlying data storage mechanism.
   - Explore the benefits of designing components with loosely coupled dependencies.

### Goals:
- Gain practical experience in applying fundamental principles of software design.
- Understand how applying these principles improves the maintainability, flexibility, and extensibility of software systems.
- Learn techniques for refactoring existing codebases to adhere to best practices in software design.
- Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among participants through pair programming and group discussions.

### Target Audience:
- Software developers interested in improving their understanding of software design principles.
- Participants with varying levels of experience in software development, from beginners to seasoned professionals.

By focusing on a single project and progressively refining it throughout the series, participants will gain a deeper understanding of how software design principles impact the evolution and quality of software systems. The collaborative nature of the Code Dojo sessions will provide opportunities for hands-on learning and knowledge exchange among participants.

## P.S. to the Presenter

As you proceed with the series, remember to encourage active participation and collaboration among participants. Discussing design principles and practices can lead to valuable insights and help reinforce learning.

Additionally, don't hesitate to adapt the content based on the feedback and progress of the participants. Flexibility is key to ensuring that the series remains engaging and relevant to the needs of the group.

Overall, I wish you and your participants a rewarding and enriching experience as you explore the evolution of the inventory management system and delve into various software design principles. If you have any further questions or need assistance in the future, feel free to reach out. Good luck with your series!
