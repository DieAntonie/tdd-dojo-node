3. The officer provides details about the incident, including the date, time, location, and description of what transpired.
4. If available, the officer attaches any supporting evidence, such as witness statements, surveillance footage, or photographs.
5. The officer identifies the individuals involved in the incident, including the inmate(s) responsible and any staff members or witnesses present.
6. Before submitting the report, the officer reviews the information to ensure accuracy and completeness.
7. Upon verification, the officer submits the incident report for review and further action by supervisory staff or administrators.

**Outcome:** A formal record of the rule violation or incident is created in the Punishment Management System, providing documentation for disciplinary proceedings and follow-up actions.

## Use Case 2: Reviewing Incident Reports
**Actor:** Supervisor or Administrator

3. For each incident report, the supervisor or administrator examines the details provided, including the description of the incident, attached evidence, and individuals involved.
4. Based on the severity and nature of the violation, the supervisor or administrator determines the appropriate disciplinary action or intervention.
5. If additional information or clarification is required, the supervisor or administrator may reach out to the reporting officer or other relevant parties for further investigation.
6. Once a decision has been made, the supervisor or administrator updates the status of the incident report in the system, indicating whether disciplinary action has been taken, an investigation is ongoing, or further review is required.
